# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions : Functions that are called (or executed) inside other functions where they are passed to as parameters.
	* Closure : Function returned from another function, so that it can remember the value of variables created inside their parent function and can also change this value. As closures can be invoked outside their parent function, initial values of variables in their parent function are not considered at subsequent calls.
	* arguments array : In javascript, arguments object is an Array-like object corresponding to the arguments passed to a function. So, items of arguments object can be reached like arrays.
	* recursion : Recursion is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result. 
	* prototype : All JavaScript objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype which is also an object.
	* constructors : It can be considered as a template that we can use for all of the different objects that we want to create. We can add functions to constructors to process the values of created objects.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
